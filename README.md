# wordclock

Original software from https://github.com/bitlair/wordclock

Uses the now available Hovstra frame from Ikea https://www.ikea.com/nl/nl/p/hovsta-fotolijst-berkenpatroon-berken-80365755/

Adapted the internal fram structure and other font for the front of the clock.

I was a little bit puzzled by the uploading of the /data directory, this is what I did
